This is our shellcode, essentially this is just a basic function that calls print for us.
These bytes would look close to something like this in a real programming language:

void call_print()
{
    print(0, ""); <- we write our arguments to the shellcode so we can get it to call print how we like
}

Here is a very good tutorial on calling functions externally, which does include the shellcode method I use here: https://guidedhacking.com/threads/calling-functions-externally-the-definitive-guide.10509/

This is just for writing to the shellcode, for instance, 'string_ptr_off' is where we'd need to write our pointer to the string we want to print

    because the call instruction we're using in our shellcode is relative, we need to get the relative address of Roblox's print function
    A relative address is defined as "an address specified by indicating its distance from another address" (https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/relative-address/)
    so this function will get the relative address for Roblox's print function from our call instruction, we minus 5 because thats how long the call instruction is
